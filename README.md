A project involving the implementation of 4 data structures: a dynamic array, a singly linked list based on one head pointer, a singly linked list based on two pointers: head and tail and a doubly linked list. Research related to the project concerned the operation time of adding and removing elements in three different positions:
- beginning of structure
- end of structure
- random place of the structure
and searching for a random number in the structure.
To carry out the above-mentioned research, it was necessary to implement functions for measuring time and generating search numbers.
